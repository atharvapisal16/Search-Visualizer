# 🔍 Search Visualizer - Python Edition
A beautiful, high-performance GUI application to visualize **Linear** and **Binary Search** algorithms in real-time. Built with **Python** and **Tkinter**, this tool bridges the gap between theory and practice.

# 📚 About Search Algorithms
Searching is a fundamental operation in computer science. This visualizer demonstrates two core approaches:

*   **Linear Search:** Sequential checking of every element. Simple but $O(n)$ complexity.
*   **Binary Search:** An efficient $O(\log n)$ algorithm that repeatedly halves the search interval (requires sorted data).

---

# ✨ Features
*   **Real-time Visualization** — Watch algorithms traverse the array step-by-step.
*   **🔢 Numerical Analysis & Stats** — Real-time tracking of **Comparison Counts**, **Time Complexity**, and **Index Tracking** to measure efficiency.
*   **Dual Themes** — Toggle between **Dark Mode 🌙** and **Light Mode ☀️**.
*   **Pseudocode Display** — Side-by-side view with active line highlighting.
*   **Speed Control** — Adjustable animation speed from **0.5x to 3.0x**.
*   **Interactive UI** — Modern interface with a clean, color-coded legend.
*   **Input Validation** — Robust error handling for non-integer or out-of-bounds inputs.

# 🧰 Technologies Used
*   **Python 3.x**
*   **Tkinter** (Standard GUI Library)
*   **Threading** (Ensures smooth, non-blocking UI during animations)

---

# 📦 Installation & Setup
### **Prerequisites**
*   **Python 3.x** installed on your system.
*   **Tkinter** (Usually included with standard Python installations).

# 🎮 Usage
To get the most out of the visualizer, follow these steps:

1.  **Select Algorithm:** Use the **Dropdown Menu** to choose between **"Binary Search"** or **"Linear Search"**.
2.  **Enter Target:** Type the **Integer** you wish to find (e.g., `31` or `89`) into the search input field.
3.  **Adjust Speed:** Slide the **Speed Controller** to your preferred pace (use **Slow** for learning, **Fast** for testing).
4.  **Start Animation:** Click the **▶ Start** button to initiate the search.
5.  **Analyze Data:** Observe the **Numerical Analysis** section to see how many comparisons the algorithm takes to find the result.
6.  **Switch UI:** Click the **Sun/Moon Icon** in the top-right corner to change the visual theme instantly.

# 🎨 Color Legend
*   <span style="color: #f39c12">■</span> **Current:** The element currently being compared.
*   <span style="color: #95a5a6">■</span> **Visited:** Elements checked and eliminated.
*   <span style="color: #2ecc71">■</span> **Found:** The target element when successfully located.
*   <span style="color: #3498db">■</span> **Default:** Unexplored elements.
